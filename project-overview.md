# Project Overview

Project Name: The "Everything" App: Adventure, Food, & Stories

Description: A single app blending city exploration (AR mocked), ingredient discovery (data mocked), and AI-generated stories (AI mocked). Kids "explore" their surroundings, find "ingredients," and the app creates a story incorporating those elements.

Features:

*   "AR" City Exploration (Mocked): The app will present a map with locations. Tapping locations triggers mock AR views (images/animations) showing ingredients.
*   Ingredient Discovery (Data Mocked): Each location reveals a mock ingredient (e.g., "Mystical Mushroom," "Dragon Fruit"). These are added to a virtual "backpack."
*   AI Story Generation (AI Mocked): Once the user collects a few ingredients, they can trigger a story. The app uses the ingredient names to create a unique, pre-written narrative. For example: "Once upon a time, a child found a Mystical Mushroom and Dragon Fruit..."
*   Kid-Friendly Interface: Bright colors, simple navigation, and engaging animations to create a captivating experience.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
